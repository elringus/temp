Being a huge anime and visual novels fan, I’ve always wanted to somehow contribute to the field. Looking through popular VN engines and toolkits, I’ve noted that none of them really meet my requirements, being either limited in platforms support or (for Unity extensions) – having scripting systems that are not practical to use in real projects.

That’s how [Naninovel](https://naninovel.com) — writer-friendly visual novel engine, which I’ve been working on for the past two years — came to life. Being a Unity extension, it provides all the benefits of the modern cross-platform game engine, and having a unique scripting feature — novel scripts — it allows composing scenarios in a way a scriptwriter would do for a movie or a play: using a familiar text editor and syntax constructs, without even opening Unity editor.
