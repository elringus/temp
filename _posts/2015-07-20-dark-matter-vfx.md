A while ago, working on [Breached](http://breached-game.com/), Iâ€™ve been figuring out how to visualize a weird in-game creature called "Keeper". It was something like an electromagnetic anomaly, stalking around and hunting for player.

The project is now using another engine and concept of those creatures completely changed, but I kinda liked the effect and decided to share it.

Here is a [Git-repo with Unity project](http://git.io/vmNpz) and an [assembled unitypackage](http://git.io/vmNpW).
