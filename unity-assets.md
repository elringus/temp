Blend Modes is an editor extension for Unity which allows you to change the blend mode of objects. Just like in Photoshop and similar image editing software, you will be able to set any of the 25 different blend modes to UI graphics or text, particle systems, 3D meshes, 2D sprites, cameras and other objects to achieve a wide range of effects.

Alpha Raycaster is a custom raycaster for UI objects built upon default Graphic Raycaster. It checks texture transparency, before deciding whether to send input events for targeted object, which allows a precise interaction with objects that have a non-rect shapes (like circles, triangles, map regions, etc).
